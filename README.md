# Hi there, I'm Mark Philips ðŸ‘‹

I'm a mobile app developer based out of the GTA in Ontario, Canada that likes experimenting with new languages & tech stacks, as well as competing in the occasional Hackathon! 

## About Me
_**When did you start programming?**_
My first encounter with programming was in my Grade 11 Java programming class. I made a 6 question demo of Are You Smarter Than A 5th Grader :joy:

_**What drew you to Mobile Development in particular?**_
I grew an affinity for Mobile Development because of how I can _see_ the results of what I'm working on. Personally, I prefer Android over iOS :sweat_smile:

_**What is your goal as a Mobile Developer?**_
As a Mobile Developer, I aim to be a better problem solver so that I can create better-working solutions than the ones that currently exist. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it....unless you can make it better":slightly_smiling_face:

_**What are your hobbies outside of programming?**_
- Guitar - been playing all genres (except country :sweat_smile:) for ~12 years 
- Indoor Rock Climbing - although I'm looking to do outdoor as well
- Gaming - PC player through and through
- 3D Printing - Mainly a hobby printing game and movie props
